# MLops Self-Learning Project

## Overview

This repository documents my self-learning journey in MLops concepts. In this project, I explore various aspects of MLops, starting with the fundamental concept of Docker.

## Docker

Docker serves as a powerful containerization platform designed to streamline the deployment of applications and their dependencies. Its core functionality revolves around packaging applications into lightweight and portable containers. These containers ensure consistent execution across diverse environments, offering a standardized and efficient deployment solution.

### Key Features

- **Portability:** Docker containers can seamlessly run on different environments, eliminating compatibility issues.
  
- **Deployment Simplification:** The platform simplifies deployment processes by encapsulating applications, enabling smooth transitions between development, testing, and production environments.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Docker empowers software development by facilitating the creation, sharing, and deployment of applications with remarkable ease.

- **Resource Utilization:** With its efficient containerization approach, Docker enhances system resource utilization, contributing to optimized performance.

## Repository Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions for building Docker images.
  
- `config`: Directory for configuration files.

- `inference.py`: Python script for performing model inference.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

To initiate the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project-directory]`.
3. Explore the Dockerfile for image configuration.
4. Run the Docker build command: `docker build -t [image-name:tag] .`.
5. Execute the Docker run command to deploy the application: `docker run -p [host-port]:[container-port] [image-name:tag] [additional-parameters]`.

Feel free to adapt and extend the project based on your learning goals. Happy exploring!
